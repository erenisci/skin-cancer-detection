# Skin Cancer Detection via Ensemble Deep Learning

This project introduces a **research-oriented deep learning pipeline** designed for the automated classification of skin lesions.  
Rather than relying on conventional single-stage classifiers, it explores a **multi-stage ensemble approach** that mirrors a structured, diagnostic reasoning process similar to how a clinician might evaluate a lesion.  
The system integrates pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and weighted ensemble strategies to differentiate between melanoma, nevus, benign vs malignant lesions, and their respective subtypes.

This work is part of an ongoing research effort in medical image analysis and aims to support the early and reliable detection of skin cancer through AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

## Project Goals

This project is designed as a **research-driven initiative** to explore novel strategies in medical image classification â€” particularly for skin cancer detection. While many existing solutions focus on isolated models or single-stage pipelines, this project takes a **multi-stage ensemble-based approach** with the goal of mimicking a more human-like, hierarchical diagnostic process.

We aim to test whether breaking the classification into meaningful stages (melanoma â†’ nevus â†’ benign/malignant â†’ subtype) can lead to better generalization, explainability, and robustness, especially when dealing with real-world noisy data and class imbalance.

Key objectives:

- Build a reliable classification system for common skin cancer types using a structured, step-wise decision pipeline.
- Improve classification accuracy by combining multiple deep learning models via weighted ensemble strategies.
- Offer a modular, extensible framework for medical imaging researchers who want to experiment with various model combinations and decision flows.
- Provide a reproducible platform for evaluating model performance across ISIC datasets (2018â€“2020).
- Encourage community collaboration for model benchmarking, validation on new datasets, and shared improvements.

> This is not just a software tool â€” it is a research playground designed to test **alternative ensemble and decision-routing strategies** in medical AI.

## Multi-Stage Classification Pipeline

The ensemble pipeline performs **five sequential classification tasks**:

1. **Melanoma Classification**  
   â†’ Binary classification to detect melanoma.

2. **Nevus Classification**  
   â†’ Binary classification to detect nevus when melanoma is not detected.

3. **Benign vs Malignant Classification**  
   â†’ Binary classification for remaining undecided cases.

4. **Malignant Subtype Classification**  
   â†’ Multi-class classification between `akiec` and `bcc`.

5. **Benign Subtype Classification**  
   â†’ Multi-class classification between `bkl`, `df`, and `vasc`.

Each stage uses an ensemble of three deep learning models (Xception, DenseNet121, CNN) with weighted soft voting.

> The entire pipeline has been developed and tested on **Google Colab**, utilizing Google Drive for model and data storage.
